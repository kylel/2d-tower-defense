# 2d-tower-defense
2d platform type tower defense using [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) and [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/)

## Running:

You cant just click on index.html. you need to serve it from a local http server (to avoid cross domain errors). I suggest using python:

> python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then open localhost:8000 in your browser. it should work.
